# Our business model

How can all this work?

---

* Sharing community
* Creator-focused
* No corporate head, only corporate partners

Corporations as a constitution was invented to protect the interests of a group of people.  Since its inception it has been broaden and now it's a more vague entity type that supports its own interests rather than the people that supoprt it. 

We still believe in the corporate structure but don't think the creativity of Amigame can reach the levels of expression we need when the driving force is a corporation that is focused on the "bottom line". 

We know how all this sounds. The most common reaction we got from people was: 

> You guys are crazy! 

Lets dig in and see why this makes sense.
