# Havenbase

A story about serenity, friendship and creativity

---

Havenbase was one of the "original" game concepts before we started the community concepts...

The concept was submitted to many indie and frankly we were seeking for help rather than showcasing the game. After being regected by all of them, we saw first hand how these events are not the way to go and concluded that no one will help us complete the game. This was an important step towards revising our practices, which gave birth to the later Amigame community you know now...
