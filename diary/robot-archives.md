A futuristic fook on the past of robotics.

---

This is a revival of an old multimedia project from 2005.

Back then there was a flash site created to accompany the release of the Audio CD.

We wanted the content to be created in an episodic form with every exhibition being a separate "level" users got to play. The museum itself in that sense is playing the role of a 3D Menu where you navigate around independent sequences. Because the content was so detatched we thought maybe we could bring an asortment of different people to create parts of the game.

The art for the museum was inspired by the credits museum on "Stanley's Parable", while the plaques contain the original content from the Audio CD.
