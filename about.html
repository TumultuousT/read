<p><i>One for all and all for one (game)...</i></p>

<p><b>am.i-ga.me</b> is one of the first user-driven game studios. We are fans of good games and want to create a community arounds us that have the passion to support original ideas and test out experimental concepts that can lead to innovation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p>Discussion is a driving for for generating new ideas and sorting out the specs of a particular feature. With your participation you can naturally influence the development and see some of your ideas come to life. </p>

<p>We are endorsing everyone's participation and believe that the more people contribute the better the final result will be. Brainstorming needs to stay true to the original vision but in a true democratic fashion everyone's input is considered with the same weight as anyone else's.</p>  

<p>To enhance the feeling of actively contributing in something constantly evolving, we are rewarding the ideas that are well-outlined or at some dergee innovative with actual prizes that can vary based on the contribution.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Experimenting often requires in depth testing that can be time consuming. Although not all gamers can code, most of them are pretty good at finding bugs. So instead of testing a product in private, and possibly delaying months in the process, am.i-ga.me releases all ruff concepts in public beta, available for you to evaluate and send in your feedback.</p>

<p>As we appreciate the effort and time consumed while testing a beta game, and understand that it both speeds up the debugging of beta games and pushes the development of new concepts, we grant the right to all users that beta test a game (and send in their reports) a free copy of the game, once "officially" released.</p>

<p>Occasionally we may organize meetups for beta testing sessions, as an excuse for mingling in person and possibly sorting out some of the "personal" issues users have with the games.</p>

<h3 id="develop">Develop</h3>

<p>Good coders are valuable. They are hard to find and are usually well rewarded.</p>

<p>Although our structure is more fluid than in most companies we are offering a restriction-free environment that forward-thinking developers may appreciate.</p>

<p>Rewarding true talent comes with no question - earth shacking contributions will definitely be noticed and am.i-ga.me is willing to form partnerships with strong individuals that push the development of concepts beyond their limits.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="share">Share</h3>

<p>Social media has become the dominant force in marketing and brand recognition.</p>

<p>As an active member that participates in the development on the games (with any way as mentioned above) it makes sense to organically want to promote the games to others.</p>

<p>But spreading the word shouldn't be taken for granted and am.i-ga.me will reward that effort with givaways (at certain times) for sharing the games through social media.</p>
