# Because...video games.
A gamer's opinion, 25 years in the making

---

I like video games. [I've played more games than I care to remember](http://raptr.com/whacko), and I have a weird habit: I want to complete the games I start. Not for the achievement, but for the story. People have laughed in my face because of this in the past. I'll complete a game even if the game doesn't let me; by switching to easy mode.

Mind you, this is not cheating. There are many people that truly believe that a video game is all about the challenge. I'll have to argue otherwise - and I'll do it with no other real choice. See, I'm in my mid thirties now; if I still thought completing a video game was a real achievement I would be a nutcase.

So, if I'm so over it why do I still play video games? Same reason I still watch movies. Because they are entertaining. They fill in a few boring hours and take away my mind from every day reality - and if I'm lucky maybe entice my imagination and broaden my perception, just a little bit. I believe I'm not alone...

Video games are no longer a recreation for children. They are serious productions for the mainstream audience. Throughout the years, many of us passionate gamers supported the idea that video games can be popular and a medium for artistic expression. And our hopes became reality. Indie games like "[Gone Home](http://thefullbrightcompany.com/gonehome/)" exercise the right to be experimental, to be character-driven and not to comply with traditional action-oriented standards.

I mention that game specifically because partly these thoughts surfaced after watching [a recent Adam Sessler video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpllLknS4b0&t=5m00s), where he states the negative reactions he received for supporting "Gone Home". I wasn't surprised to hear it, but I thought it was an obvious expression of fear from firm supporters of the "status quo".

This is how it is and how it always has been. **Progress is driven by small groups of people and the mass is more often than not dragged kicking and screaming**. Until the next generation accumulates all existing innovation and takes it for granted. I'm not even gonna go into psychoanalyzing these reactions - I'll just say that if we turned the tables, a loud mouth trolling the CoD forums, cursing everyone for being trained killers is widely perceived as a douchebag.

Public opinion is even more confused by the fact that there's a (temporary) personality disorder in video games, as they try to evolve into an art form but at the same time stay true to their origin - testing accuracy, reflexes and endurance. Ultimately we may need to make a clear distinction and separate story-driven games from challenge-driven games. Those games that have a thought provoking intention and those that are testing skill. That could allow the medium to be used in more than one distinct ways and each branch could excel in their own regard by giving it a better opportunity to grow independently. I'd be happy to see sports video games gain recognition and championships around them gather a mass audience. But I don't think there's a relation between them and story-driven games.

I don't think I'm saying anything original here. Video itself as a medium has multiple expressions and we are all very accustomed in separating sports from movies on TV. To continue this analogy, the current state in video games is a bit like someone proclaiming the following:

> I watched that movie twice as fast and got all the plot points!

If that's how you watch movies, someone will surely update you that you're doing it wrong. With that in mind, why should speed-running through a game, trying to unlock everything be the goal for any story-driven experience?

In no way I'm suggesting that achievements should be removed from any video game. **Achievements are an integral part of the satisfaction in video games**. I'm merely stating that if we extract the challenge that tests skill maybe then we can start evaluating video games based on the sheer entertainment they offer and express their merits focusing on the emotional spectrum; like excitement, curiosity, angst, thrill, happiness...
