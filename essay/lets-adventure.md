# [WIP] Let's Adventure

we believe that you should experience video games not as an "out of body" experience - that's why we believe for our types of games third person view doesn't work. 

In movies we are passive spectators, and as such we are used to looking at characters as a third-person. the camera is witnessing the events and we take on a witness role looking through it. 

in video games we are active participants of the events, in fact we might be instrumental for the evolution of certain scenarios. 

we need to experience things in the first perspective if we are ever going to believe that the character we are playing is in fact US, and not some puppet we control from the outside. 

suspension of disbelief ends in video games when we can see our character as an alien body. and when that's gone, well we're just playing out a really bar movie, aren't we?
