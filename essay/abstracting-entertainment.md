How do you recreate an experience in different formats

## Problem

How do you recreate an experience in different formats

---

## Movies

The "witness from a perfect angle" artform

---

### Strengths

Movies hold the lead in storytelling, because it is:

* Contained (~2h)
* Refined

---

### Limitations

* Static presentation
* Set camera angles
* Set sequence of events
* Same Experience for all

---

## Video Games

The "interactive experience" artform

Spoiler: Recreating the movie format is NOT the objective.
---

### Strengths

* Interaction invites increased engagement
* Opportunity to create unique experiences
* Reusable/renewable sceneries, assets, props...

---

### Limitations

Suspension of disbelief is limited due to:

* Non photorealistic visuals
* No real humans (actors)

---

## Audience Expectations...

---

### People want to see:

* Peculiar settings
* Explosions
* Fights
* A 'problem' that needs resolution

---

## Re-inventing Entertainment

---

## The Riddle

---

Life is by default uncertain and the "problems" occur in natural manner. Not everyone will experience the same thing, not everyone will see things the same way. That's not a limitation, it's a feature...

---

The real problem is... you don't know what the problem is.

## Hyper-realism

Games try to simulate reality but what the player wants is an idealized reality where things work for him.

** Superpowers
- Telekinisis
- Controlling time (slow, stop, revert)
- Strength / Agility

.. are all expected by the gamer.


## Length

Movies have a strict time constraight.

Timing an experience is a thing of the past. A game should be both casual and ongoing - it should scale and be always fresh.

Games have the opportunity to deepen the storyline by allowing the time to reasearch.

## Credits

Writing this presentation begun after watching "Logan's Run" (1975), a good example of where the video game storytelling is at the moment...
