## Origin

I'm a fan of the Tex Murphy games;


## Art style

The game should be BW (black and white) with a stark contrast like in Sin City.


## Technology

* City builder
* Shooting mechanics


## Gameplay

First-person view.


## Goals

The main goal of the game is to complete cases. The cases could be created by other players as challenges.
